# What is Component?

In simple words Component are nothing but it's a "Normal Funtion". But, here it is not ended. Have a look on this :- 

When we learn new Technology then at that point we came up with lot of confusion and fear. But, when we start exploring then all confusions and specially our fear which is associated with that is going to be reduce time-to-time.

When I was beginner in React then at that time I don't understand it properly. But, now I can say that if we understand what component exactly is, then I can sure you that you finished React almost 90%. Because when we know the mechanism of components that how it is working under the hood then I it going to be very easy to understand React. 

To be more precise React is all about "Understanding the mechanism of components" at begining stage. There are lots of other thing that we have to learn but they don't really matter a lot. What matter is to Understand the concept of working of Components.

# If Components are Functions then what is special in React?

Yes.

As I told you that there are lots of thing in React that we have to learn but it not matters a lot. We have to understand that how we able to write "HTML" in component which is basically a Function?


In other words the HTML we are writing in React called "JSX(Mixing of JavaScript with HTML)". This is the beauty of React. And the most important feature is that react Paint only the DOM file which is manipulated.   

There are lots of features in react but for now this is sufficient for better understanding.

# How does React see these Components?

We know that browser creates a DOM and every DOM element is an Object for browser. This statement is very important to understand React. Here is a catch! Let's understand.....

In React also, All components and it's child is also converted into an Object. We have already seen in "Create Custom React" folder, that we can create our custom React but it basically for understanding perpose for how React finally work under the hood. And we also understood that we can't render our custom object in React because React has it's own method to take arguments. 

Finally, all Components are going to be render as an Object. That's it.
