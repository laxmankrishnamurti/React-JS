# Key Points ::

- React dosen't understand 'HTML syntax'
- Bundler helps React to understand it using 'jsx'.
- jsx means "Mixing of JavaScript with HTML"
- Just for the sake, if all components are functions then we can simply call it. But, this is not recommended because of Syntax Guidline of React.
- End of the dat Function are Function.
- All 'jsx' or 'components' file parse into an Object and because of that React creates "Virtual DOM".
- Behind the scene all components are converted in object bby "babel".
