# React-JS
Learning React (A Library of JavaScript)

# What is React?

React is a JavaScript Library. But, at the end of the day React converts all it's components into HTML, CSS & JS files. React only create SPA(Single page application)

# What is Library?

In Programming, a Library is a collection of pre-written program that simplifies the development of the technology in which the library has been written. 

In case of React, it is written in JavaScript so it simplifies the development of JavaScript-based applications, especially for "AJAX" and other web-centric technologies.

# Why we use React?

- It is used to build Component based UI(User Interface)
- It makes easy to manage and build Complex Frontend.
- Reusability of Components

# Interesting Fact about React

- React is build by Facebook. 
- Initially, many the Tech community took it as a joke. But, this was only a mistake. Now, we all are know that how React is Popular in today's world!
- React was created when both UI & State(variables) dosen't  syncing together. This is popularly known as "Fantom Message Problem"
- Initially, React's Components are typically "Class-based". But, now React is totally based on Functions. 

- React offers more Attachment.
  - React-DOM     {For Web-Applications}
  - React-Native   {For Android-Applications}

# Requirement / Prerequisits

- Install Node.js
- After installing Node.js we have the 'npm or npx' package bydefault.

# Command for Normal ReactApp

- Installations :: npx create-react-app "Project-Name"
- Go Live       :: npm run start {To launch the ReactApp}

While creating you might notice that the whole process will very slow. Because, create-react-app gives us more Dependencies which is not usable at this stage. So, we can use "vite" for fast installing.

# What is vite?

Vite is a Open-source JavaScript module bundler. It helps to create React Projects. It is quite similar to "create-react-app". It works like a Local Development Server.

# Command for ReactApp using Vite

- Installations :: npm create vite@latest
  - Step-01 : Assign Project Name
  - Step-02 : Select React
  - Step-03 : Select JavaScript or the combination in which you are interest to do the Project.

But at this stage we don't hava access of "Node-module folder". So, for installing the folder run the below command :- 
- npm i  {i stands for Install}
- Go Live       :: npm run dev {see more command in package.json files}

Here, we are ready to Create React project.

                                            HAPPY CODING!!!!!!
